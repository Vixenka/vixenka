### Hi || ohayo ðŸ‘‹
I'm Vixen, a programmer enthusiast who loves performance, because I treat programming as art.

Currently I'm creating my own [game engine](https://github.com/NoiseStudio/NoiseEngine), but in the future I want to create my own next-generation programming language and OS based on own JIT compiler assisted with AOT optimizations.
